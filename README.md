# ES1050-PythonGUI
A simple Python GUI I used in one of my culminting projects.

This GUI is meant to be used with the Camera Mouse propriatory software from http://cameramouse.org/. 
This design goal of this project was based on providing people with mobility challenges the tool to Pause and Play music using just their eyes.
