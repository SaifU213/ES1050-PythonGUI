# ES1050-PythonGUI
A simple Python GUI I used in one of my culminating projects.

This GUI is meant to be used with the Camera Mouse proprietary software from http://cameramouse.org/. 
The design goal of this project was based on providing people with mobility challenges a tool to Pause and Play music using just their eyes. In this case the music player was Spotify.
